      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, world! My name is Laiko Cayanan and I am a 25 year old video editor hoping to transition my career into software engineering. Some of my favorite things in the world include solo night drives home, crane games where you win stuffed animals, my fat corgi named Basti, and anything covered in ranch. Thanks for reading and <i>happy coding!</i></p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Okinawa, Japan but raised in San Diego, California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Photography/Videography, doordashing food and watching anime, making playlists, being in nature with good company, and trying new cafes on the hunt for cutest dessert.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to end up working in a tech company. Preferably one that has those huge buffet style cafeterias.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Just relocated to Austin, Texas!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>One of my friends said that developers are the modern day version of blacksmiths; both of them spend countless amount of time trying to perfect their craft in order to create tools/technology that everyone will use. Along with this, some of the things that motivate my career shift is the money (obviously), opportunity for constant growth, stability of the profession because technology is everchanging, and the marketing doors it opens when I start a future business and I'll have the skills to make my own website. Plus, envisioning myself as a cyber blacksmith makes the process that much more enjoyable!</p>
